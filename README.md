## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone.**

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:rapuhotelli/ocf-wip.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    ```sh
    cd ocf-wip/
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `ocf-wip` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
